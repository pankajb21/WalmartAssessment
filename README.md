# WalmartAssessment
Walmart Project
Download the working image from : git clone https://github.com/pankajb21/WalmartAssessment.git

To build the project from scratch : 
  git clone https://github.com/pankajb21/WalmartAssessment.git
  cd WalmartAssessment/
Import the project in eclipse. 
Clean and build the project.
Run the project as configuration with main class as "org.testng.TestNG". 
Logs will give step by details. 
  
Technical Choices: 
Used Java as the base language. 
Using selenium web driver to run the test cases. 
TestNG for reports. 

Things if I had more time: 
I would like to keep the data is excel sheet and build a data driven framework. 
Needed more time for iOS devices testing. It is working fine for web based. 
I donâ€™t have much experience on running tests on mobile. We can use Robotium for this purpose.  

Note: To run in chrome, please change permission of chromedriver to 777. Sometime it might fail because of permission issues.
